# TODO: Add some titles, introduction, ...


# TODO: Request user input


# TODO: Call the API using the user's input
#   - url is already defined above
#   - create a params dict based on the user's input
#   - finally call your API using the requests package


# TODO: retrieve the results
#   - add a little check if you got an ok response (status code 200) or something else
#   - retrieve the prediction from the JSON


# TODO: display the prediction in some fancy way to the user


# TODO: [OPTIONAL] maybe you can add some other pages?
#   - some statistical data you collected in graphs
#   - description of your product
#   - a 'Who are we?'-page
